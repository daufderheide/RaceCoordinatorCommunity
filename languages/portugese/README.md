# Info
This is a translation of into Portugese.  It's done as a "custom.json" file to make it easier to use.  

Simply copy the include custom.json file to your /data/Languages directory. If you already have a custom.json file you should add these entries into your existing custom.json file so you do not overwrite your existing customizations.
To find your <install_dir> simply go to the Race Day Setup screen and use the File->Open Install Folder menu option.

# Note
If this is viewed as a full and accurate translation, it could be included with the RaceCoordinator install with the proper language code prefix so that all uses with a portugese language setting can enjoy the tranlation.
