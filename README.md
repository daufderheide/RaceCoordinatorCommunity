# RaceCoordinator Community
This github repo is a collection of community created works used to customize [Race Coordinator](https://racecoordinator.net/).  Using github has a lot of advantages.  At its core it is searchable, provides a single place where all RaceCoordinator users can share content, and it's version controlled.  This all means easier distrubtion of content and an easy way to update/fix that content over time.

# Using community files
Using community files is easy.  If you only want a single file, click on the file and select download.  If you want multiple files at once consider downloading the entire folder or even cloning/forking this repo to your computer (google github clone or fork if you don't know how, it's really easy).

# Contributing
Contributing to this community repository is as easy as using git hub.  There are plenty of resources or ask how to do it on one of the many slot car forums.  Ultimately you'll need to fork this repository, make your changes, then do a pull request to me to update the main public repository.  You can even do a pull request to add better instructions in this readme for users.

See the [contribute guide](https://github.com/daufderheide/RaceCoordinatorCommunity/blob/main/contribute_guide.md) in this repo for a simple walkthrough.
