## How We Use These Flags - An optional alternative
Some might ask why or how the US flag is used.  Here is a screen capture of the Race Manager, Images configuration menu used by our club.  When a race is not running RC displays the US Flag (RC: Red Flag).  During a race when a track call is initiated and power is shut off to the track thereby stopping all the cars we consider that a red flag (RC Yellow Flag).  A corresponding change to the audio results in the correct announcement.  When the leader crosses the finish line for the heat win the checkered flag is displayed (RC: White Flag).  There is essentially no yellow flag on purpose as in real racing that is where cars would be going slow around the track.
