# 2020 SCREENS
These screen/XAML files, and their supporting files, make up a modernised Race
Coordinator skin/theme that drags Race Coordinator into the 21st century.  This
has been achieved by using modern font and colours, and by removing gradients
to create a flatter look.

## EXTRACT THE FILES
1. Using Windows Explorer, locate the 2020Screens_x.x.zip file you have downloaded.
2. Right-click the file and select Extract All....
3. Select a suitable location to extract to (the default is usually fine) and
   click the Extract button.
4. Once extraction is complete, you should have the following directories extracted:
   - Audio
   - Images
   - Languages
   - XAML

## INSTALLATION
There are two options for installation, manual and automated.  Automated is the
easiest way to install the 2020 Screens, however it utilises a PowerShell
script that you should not be comfortable in running.  The Manual method will
allow you to maintain more control, but will take longer, especially if you
have a large number of races to configure.


## MANUAL INSTALLATION

### Installation overview
- Copy the new screen files (some will need to overwrite existing files)
- Copy the custom.json file
- Copy the new images
- Copy the new audio files

    directories (default locations are listed above) to a safe location

### Copy the screen files
1. Copy all the files from the extracted XAML directory to the data\xaml
   directory in your Race Coordinator install location

## AUTOMATED INSTALLATION

### Automated installation prerequisities
- Administrator privilege is required to access the Race Coordinator files and
  database
- Before starting this procedure, please close Race Coordinator if it is running
- PowerShell is required to run the automation script
  - PowerShell is automatically installed on Windows 7 and above
  - PowerShell can be installed manually on Windows XP
- It is highly recommended to backup your existing Race Coordinator install
  before performing any steps below.
  - A backup can be performed by simply copying the install and data
    directories (default locations are listed above) to a safe location
- PowerShell modules that will be installed automatically if not present:
  - The NuGet package provider:  Required to install the SQLite module
  - PSSQLite: SQLite module required to interact with the Race Coordinator database

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| NOTE: A PowerShell script is a very powerful thing, especially when run with |
|       Administrator privilege.  You should never run a PowerShell script on  |
|       your computer unless you read through the script and understand what   |
|       it is doing, or you trust the source of the script.                    |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

### Run the PowerShell script
1. Click Start, find PowerShell (it may be called Windows PowerShell),
   right-click it and select Run as administrator.
   - If you get a User Account Control prompt, click yes.
2. Change to the directory where you have extracted the 2020Screens.zip file.
3. Type .\install2020Screens.ps1 then press enter.
   - If you get a ...install2020Screens.ps1 cannot be loaded... error when
     running the script, type:
     Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
     and press enter, then repeat step 3.
4. If Race Coordinator is running you will be prompted for the script to
   close it before continuing, there are three options:
   - Yes:  The script will force Race Coordinator to close, then continue.
           Type y then press enter to select this option.
   - No (default):  The script will wait for you to close Race Coordinator,
                    then select OK to continue.  Press enter or type n then
                    press enter to select this option.
   - Cancel:  The script will exit and no further installation steps will be
              done.  Type c then press enter to select this option.
5. During the Updating race configurations phase, you will be prompted to
   update each race in the Race Coordinator database, you will have four
   options:
   - Yes (default):  The script will update this race configuration, then
                     prompt for the next one.  Press enter or type y then
                     press enter to select this option.
   - Yes to all:  The script will update this race configuration, then update
                  the remaining race configurations witout prompting again.
                  Type a then press enter to select this option.
   - No:  The script will skip this race configuration, then prompt for the
          next one.  Type n then press enter to select this option.
   - Cancel:  The script will exit and no further installation steps will be
              done.  Type c then press enter to select this option.
6. Close the PowerShell window.
7. Start racing...


## MAINTENANCE
Some of the installation steps above required overwriting some of the original
Race Coordinator files, a Race Coordinator update may reset these files back to
their original state.
If that happens:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| NOTE: The reason why the install is so complicated is to avoid this   |
|       behaviour, however, there are a few file replacements we cannot |
|       avoid.                                                          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+


### Manual Maintenance
1. If necessary, repeat the [Extract the files](#extract-the-files) section
   above
2. Repeat the [Copy the screen files](#copy-the-screen-files) section above
   (specifically the five named files in that section)
3. Repeat the [Copy the audio](#copy-the-audio) files section above

### Automated Maintenance
1. If necessary, repeat the [Extract the files](#extract-the-files) section
   above
2. Repeat the [Run the PowerShell script](#run-the-powershell-script) section
   above

## Changing the Theme
There are three colour themes included, two dark themes: Burnt Orange (the
default) and Dark Seafoam Green, and one light theme: Dark Seafoam Green.

To change the theme, follow these steps:
1. Close Race Coordinator
2. Navigate to the data\xaml directory in your Race Coordinator install
   location (see Manual installation prerequisities above for information on
   the install location)
3. Delete the 2020ThemeDictionary.xaml file (or rename it if you are not
   comfortable deleting it)
4. Copy and paste back into the same directory the file for the theme you
   would like to use, this will create a2020ThemeDictionary-xxxxxd - Copy.xaml file
   - e.g. 2020ThemeDictionary-Dark-DarkSeafoamGreen.xaml would get copied to
     2020ThemeDictionary-Dark-DarkSeafoamGreen - Copy.xaml
   - Note, the theme files are named as follows:

      Theme                      | Filename
      -------------------------- | -----------------------------------------------
      Dark - Burnt Orange        | 2020ThemeDictionary-Dark-BurntOrange.xaml
      Dark - Dark Seafoam Green  | 2020ThemeDictionary-Dark-DarkSeafoamGreen.xaml
      Light - Dark Seafoam Green | 2020ThemeDictionary-Light-DarkSeafoamGreen.xaml

5. Rename the copied file to 2020ThemeDictionary.xaml
